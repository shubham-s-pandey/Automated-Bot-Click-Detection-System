# Automated Bot Click Detection System

## Description
This project is designed to distinguish between automated bot clicks and human clicks. It uses JavaScript event listeners to track mouse and touch events, and sends this information to a server via AJAX requests. The server-side PHP script then processes this data to determine whether the clicks are likely to be from a human or a bot.

## How to Use
1. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file.
2. Update the PHP script with your server details.
3. Monitor the server logs to see the results.

## Note
Please modify and use it according to your needs.
